# Learning Cardiotocography Clustering

Welcome to the Cardiotocography Clustering repository! This repository provides a script written in R for performing k-means clustering optimization on the Cardiotocography dataset. The script aims to find the best grouping for the dataset based on specific evaluation criteria.

## What is Cardiotocography (CTG)?

Cardiotocography is a medical procedure used to monitor the fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contractions (UC) during pregnancy. The Cardiotocography dataset consists of 2126 fetal cardiotocograms (CTGs), which were automatically processed and classified by expert obstetricians.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `script.R`: This script contains the main code for loading the dataset, performing k-means clustering, and evaluating the clustering results.
- `cardioto_noClass_corr.csv`: The dataset file used in the script.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, instructions, and contributions.
- `Learn.md` (this file): Provides additional information and guidance on learning about Cardiotocography clustering.

## Getting Started

To get started with learning about Cardiotocography clustering, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cardiotocography-clustering.git`.
2. Familiarize yourself with the README.md file, which provides an overview of the project, instructions, and contributions.
3. Open the script.R file in an R environment or script editor to examine the code and understand the different steps involved in the clustering process.
4. Download the `cardioto_noClass_corr.csv` dataset file and explore its attributes to gain an understanding of the data.
5. Run the script step by step or execute the entire script to observe the clustering optimization process.
6. Analyze the outputs and results to understand the performance of the k-means algorithm and the impact of different parameters on the clustering accuracy.
7. Experiment with different variations of the script and dataset to explore alternative clustering algorithms, evaluation methods, or preprocessing techniques.
8. Refer to external resources or consult academic literature on clustering algorithms and Cardiotocography analysis to deepen your understanding.
